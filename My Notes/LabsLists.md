   - **Tools**: OpenSSL, HashCalc, GPG

## 3. **Availability Lab: Building a Redundant System**
   - **Description**: Create a redundant server setup with failover capabilities to ensure high availability.
   - **Tools**: HAProxy, Keepalived, VirtualBox/Proxmox

## 4. **Non-Repudiation Lab: Digital Signatures and Proof of Delivery**
   - **Description**: Implement digital signatures and time-stamping to ensure non-repudiation in communications.
   - **Tools**: OpenSSL, Certbot, Time Stamping Services

## 5. **Authentication Lab: Setting Up Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - **Description**: Configure and test multi-factor authentication (MFA) for a web application or system.
   - **Tools**: Google Authenticator, Authy, Duo Security

## 6. **Authorization Lab: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
