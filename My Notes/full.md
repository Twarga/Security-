## Cryptographic Solutions Overview
### Importance of using Appropriate Cryptographic Solutions
- Cryptographic solutions are crucial for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. Proper implementation protects against unauthorized access, data breaches, and tampering, which is essential in maintaining secure communications and data storage.

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- **Public Key:** A key used for encryption that can be shared publicly. It is used to encrypt data which can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.

- **Private Key:** A key kept secret by the owner. It is used to decrypt data encrypted with the public key or to create digital signatures.

- **Key Escrow:** A method where a copy of the private key is stored by a third party (escrow agent) to allow access in case the original key is lost or the owner is unavailable.

### Encryption
- **Levels:**
  - **Full-Disk:** Encrypts the entire disk drive, protecting all data on the disk.
  - **Partition:** Encrypts individual partitions of a disk.
  - **File:** Encrypts specific files on a disk.
  - **Volume:** Encrypts a logical storage unit (volume) within a disk.
  - **Database:** Encrypts data stored in a database to protect it from unauthorized access.
  - **Record:** Encrypts individual records within a database.
- **Transport/Communication:** Encryption of data during transmission over a network to protect against eavesdropping and interception.
- **Asymmetric:** Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption.
- **Symmetric:** Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. It is faster but requires secure key distribution.
- **Key Exchange:** The process of securely exchanging encryption keys between parties.
- **Algorithms:** Various methods and formulas used for encryption (e.g., AES, RSA, DES).
- **Key Length:** The size of the encryption key, which determines the strength of the encryption. Longer keys generally provide stronger security.

### Tools
- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM):** A hardware-based security solution that provides cryptographic operations and secure key storage.
- **Hardware Security Module (HSM):** A physical device that manages and protects cryptographic keys and performs encryption/decryption operations.
- **Key Management System:** Software or hardware systems used to generate, distribute, and manage cryptographic keys.
- **Secure Enclave:** A dedicated area of a processor that provides isolated execution and storage for sensitive data.

### Obfuscation
- **Steganography:** The practice of hiding data within other non-secret data, such as embedding a message within an image.
- **Tokenization:** Replacing sensitive data with unique identifiers or tokens that are useless outside of the tokenization system.
- **Data Masking:** Hiding or altering data to protect sensitive information while retaining its format and usability for testing or other purposes.


### Hashing
- Hashing transforms data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash value or digest. Hash functions are used for verifying data integrity.

### Salting
- Adding a random value (salt) to data before hashing to ensure that identical data produces different hash values, protecting against precomputed hash attacks (rainbow tables).

### Digital Signatures
- A method of verifying the authenticity and integrity of a message or document using a combination of hashing and asymmetric encryption. The signature is created with a private key and verified with the corresponding public key.

### Key Stretching

- A technique used to make cryptographic keys more resistant to brute-force attacks by applying a hashing function multiple times or using computationally intensive algorithms.

### Blockchain
- A decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the data is secure and tamper-proof.

### Certificates
- **Certificate Authorities (CAs):** Trusted entities that issue digital certificates, which validate the ownership of public keys.
- **Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs):** Lists of certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date.
- **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP):** A protocol used to obtain the revocation status of a certificate in real-time.
- **Self-Signed:** Certificates signed by the same entity that created them, without a third-party CA.
- **Third-Party:** Certificates issued and signed by an external CA.
- **Root of Trust:** The base of a certification chain, trusted by all other certificates in the chain.
- **Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Generation:** The process of creating a request for a digital certificate, including public key and identity information.
- **Wildcard Certificates:** Certificates that secure a domain and all its subdomains with a single certificate.
