# XSS
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of injection security attack in which an attacker injects data, such as a malicious script, into content from otherwise trusted websites. Cross-site scripting attacks happen when an untrusted source is allowed to inject its own code into a web application, and that malicious code in included with dynamic content delivered to a victim's browser.
